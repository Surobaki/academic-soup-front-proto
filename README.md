# Academic Soup (proto)
This repository is for a prototype of my handmade personal website (_handmade_ = no major frameworks used). Whether this frontend will make it to the actual website is uncertain.

**Development note:** in the `index.html` file you may find a line in `<head>` that imports `live.js`. For copyright simplicity reasons I excluded this from my repository and it's one's own responsibility to download it or find an alternative. It's only used for development, not production.
